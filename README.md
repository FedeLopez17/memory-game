# Harry Potter Memory Game ðŸš‚ ðŸ¦‰ ðŸª„
### ðŸ”— [Check out the live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/memory-game/) 

## Description:
This project is part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths)<br>
It is a simple memory game where the goal is to select all cards without selecting the same card twice.<br>
I decided to make it Harry Potter-themed, as it is a series of books and movies I've thoroughly enjoyed.
The API used was [PotterAPI](https://github.com/fedeperin/potterapi) <br>

## New things learned:
The main goal of this project was to practice fetching from a public API using the `useEffect` hook. Despite already having used said hook prior to this project, I now feel more comfortable with it.<br>
This project also allowed me to get more comfortable with Vite, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.<br>
Originally intending to use a different API, I learned by reading its documentation that in order to use that API I had to create a proxy server. So, consequentially, I delved into understanding CORS mechanisms, the function of Proxy servers, scenarios where their usage proves beneficial, and different types of APIs. While much of this information was not entirely new to me, revisiting these concepts served as a valuable refresher.<br>
In the end, I decided not to use the aforementioned API, but I plan to come back in the near future and use it in a new implementation of this project, that's what the videogames-version branch is for.
